<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The principles are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Data is <span style="font-weight: bolder;">immutable</span>. It is never mutated in-place.</li>
    <li>Changes to data are encapsulated into <span style="font-weight: bolder;">operations</span> that take a previous version and return a new one.</li>
    <li>History is represented as a <span style="font-weight: bolder;">list of states</span>, with past on one end, the present on the other, and an index that can back up into 'undo states'.</li>
    <li>Modifying data causes any <span style="font-weight: bolder;">future states to be thrown away</span>.</li>
</ul>
